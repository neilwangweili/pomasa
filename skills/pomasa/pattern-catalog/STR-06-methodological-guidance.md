## Problem

How to ensure AI Agents execute tasks according to correct methodology?

Domain knowledge tells Agents "what is", but not "how to do it". Agents need methodological guidance to know: where data comes from, how to assess credibility, what methods to use for analysis, and what format to output. If this information is missing or implicit in the Blueprint, it leads to:

- Inconsistent data quality (not knowing which sources are credible)
- Insufficient analysis depth (not knowing which questions to answer)
- Inconsistent output formats (each Agent decides format independently)
- Difficulty adjusting methodology (requiring modifications to multiple Blueprints)

## Context

This pattern applies in the following scenarios:

- System needs to execute tasks with clear methodology (e.g., academic research, data analysis)
- Multiple Agents need to follow unified methods and standards
- Methodology may need to be adjusted independently of Agent logic
- Domain experts need to be able to review and improve methodology

## Forces

- **Specific vs Flexible**: Too specific limits Agent flexibility, too flexible leads to inconsistent execution
- **Complete vs Concise**: Complete guides are lengthy, concise ones may miss key points
- **General vs Specialized**: General methods have broad applicability, specialized methods are more precise
- **Standardized vs Innovative**: Strict standards ensure consistency but may inhibit innovation

## Solution

**Externalize methodological guidance as independent configuration files, managed separately from domain knowledge. Methodology files should be specific enough to be executable, including explicit checklists.**

- **Maintenance Costs**: Methodology evolution requires synchronized document updates
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Strict methodology may limit Agent's flexible response

## Implementation Guidelines

### Determining Level of Detail

Methodological guidance should be **specific enough to be executable**, not vague generalizations:

| Poor Approach | Good Approach |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Pay attention to data quality" | "Data sources are divided into 5 categories with credibility ratings as follows: Academic articles (High), Policy documents (High), Industry reports (Medium-High)..." |
| "Follow academic standards" | "Every argument must be supported by data or cases, citation format is [Source Name](URL)" |
| "Maintain objectivity" | "Must see both achievements and problems, avoid one-sided tendency in expressions" |
| "Standardized output format" | "Level 1 heading uses #, only one in the entire document; Level 2 heading uses ##; lists have blank lines before and after" |

### Value of Checklists

Each methodology file should include **checkable checklists** to facilitate verification of execution quality:

```markdown
## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Are all analysis points covered?
- [ ] Does each analysis point have empirical material support?
- [ ] Is there both positive analysis and problem identification?
- [ ] Can all citations be traced to original sources?
- [ ] Is the language formal and objective?
- [ ] Is the structure complete and logic clear?
```

### Relationship with Domain Knowledge

Methodological guidance and domain knowledge should be **managed separately**:

```
references/
├── domain/                    # Domain Knowledge
│   ├── theoretical_framework.md
│   └── literature_review.md
│
└── methodology/               # Methodological Guidance
    ├── research-overview.md
    ├── data-sources.md
    ├── analysis-methods.md
    └── output-template.md
```

Benefits of this separation:
- Domain knowledge can be reused across different methodologies
- Methodology can evolve independently of domain knowledge
- Clear responsibilities, facilitating maintenance by different roles

## Examples

### From industry_assessment System

**analysis-methods.md (Core Questions section)**:

```markdown
## Analysis Framework

This research adopts the ESSCC theoretical framework for systematic analysis. For each functional item, the following five core questions need to be answered:

### Question 1: Function Manifestation
**How is this ESSCC function manifested in this industry?**

Analysis points:
- Look for specific instances such as institutional arrangements, policy measures, corporate behaviors
- Use data and cases to illustrate specific manifestations of the function
- Distinguish between "direct manifestation" and "indirect manifestation"

### Question 2: Positive Effects
**What benefits has this manifestation brought to the development of this industry?**

Analysis points:
- Quantified development achievements (scale, growth rate, market share, etc.)
- Technological progress and innovation achievements
- Enhancement of international competitiveness
...

### Question 3: Deficiencies
**Are there situations where this function is insufficiently manifested in this industry?**

Analysis points:
- Objective assessment, do not avoid problems
- Gaps compared to ideal state or international benchmarks
...
```

**data-sources.md (Credibility Rating section)**:

```markdown
## Data Source Types

### 1. Academic Articles
- Academic papers from databases like CNKI, Wanfang
- Working papers from platforms like SSRN, ResearchGate
- **Priority**: High
- **Credibility**: High

### 2. Policy Documents
- Policy documents issued by the State Council and various ministries
- Relevant policies from local governments
- **Priority**: High
- **Credibility**: High

### 3. Industry Research Reports

## Sources to Use Cautiously

The following types of information sources should be **used cautiously** or **avoided**:

- Purely personal blog articles (non-professionals)
- Subjective comments from self-media (lacking data support)
- Content with obvious commercial promotional purposes
```
