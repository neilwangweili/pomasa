[Describe: What methods will you use to analyze the data? If you have a specific analytical framework or dimensions, explain here. You can also write "to be suggested by AI"]

---

## Output Format

**Report Format**:

[Describe: What form should the final report take? e.g., academic paper, research report, analysis summary, etc.]

**Report Structure**:

[Describe: The organizational structure of the report. You can also write "to be suggested by AI"]

**Deliverable File Formats**:

## Pattern Selection

For the complete pattern list, see [pattern-catalog/README.md](./pattern-catalog/README.md)

**Quality Assurance Level**:

- [ ] Simple: Only adopt required patterns, no additional quality checks
- [x] Standard (default): Adopt QUA-01 Embedded Quality Standards + BHV-05 Grounded Web Research
- [ ] Strict: Adopt QUA-01 + QUA-02 Multi-Layer Quality Assurance + BHV-05 Grounded Web Research

**Other Patterns to Enable or Disable**:

[Fill in: If you have special requirements, explain here. If none, write "None"]

## Custom Tools Configuration (Optional)

If you have custom MCP tools for web research, you can configure them here. This is useful for:
- **Enhanced capabilities**: Commercial services (e.g., Oxylabs) can bypass paywalls
- **Cost optimization**: Self-hosted tools can reduce AI provider API quota consumption

**Custom Web Search Tool**:

[Fill in: Tool name for web search, e.g., `mcp__crawl4ai__search` or `mcp__serper-search__google_search`. Leave blank to use default `WebSearch`]

**Custom Web Fetch Tool**:

[Fill in: Tool name for fetching web content, e.g., `mcp__crawl4ai__read_url` or `mcp__serper-search__scrape`. Leave blank to use default `WebFetch`]

**Fallback Strategy**:

- [x] Fallback to default tools when custom tools fail (recommended)
- [ ] Use custom tools only, fail if unavailable

For more details, see [BHV-06 Configurable Tool Binding](./pattern-catalog/BHV-06-configurable-tool-binding.md).

## Other Requirements

[Fill in: Any other constraints, expectations, or special requirements. If none, write "None"]
