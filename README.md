# POMASA

**Pattern-Oriented Multi-Agent System Architecture**

## Purpose

POMASA is a pattern language and generation toolkit for building Declarative Multi-Agent Systems.

Its core value proposition: **Enable AI to rapidly construct new MAS systems guided by patterns**.

## Overall Approach

### Problem

When building multi-agent systems, every team uses their own approach to construct systems and their own terminology to describe architecture. The lack of a common pattern language makes it difficult to:
- Disseminate knowledge
- Reuse experience
- Discuss problems clearly

### Solution

POMASA adopts a "pattern language + generator" approach:

1. **Pattern Catalog** (`pattern-catalog/`): Reusable architectural patterns extracted from real systems, each describing a specific problem and its solution
2. **Generator** (`generator.md`): A prompt that guides AI to build new systems based on patterns

### Core Principles

- **Patterns are knowledge carriers**: Transform tacit architectural experience into explicit, shareable patterns
- **Patterns have necessity levels**: Required, Recommended, Optional—systems can be flexibly composed
- **AI is the executor**: AI reads pattern documents, understands design principles, and generates pattern-conforming systems
- **Continuous evolution**: New patterns are added as practice accumulates

## How to Use the Generator

### Scenario 1: Building a New Research-Oriented MAS

**Step 1**: Copy `user_input_template.md` to your working directory and fill in your research project information

**Step 2**: Issue a command to Claude Code:

```
Please read pomasa/generator.md, then generate a multi-agent research system based on [your user_input file path].
```

The Generator will guide the AI to:
1. Read your completed user_input
2. Read the relevant patterns in pattern-catalog
3. Select the appropriate pattern combination based on your needs
4. Generate the complete system files

### Scenario 2: Understanding or Improving an Existing System

```
Please read pomasa/pattern-catalog/README.md, then analyze which patterns [a system directory] uses and what improvements could be made.
```

### Scenario 3: Learning MAS Architecture

Read the pattern documents under `pattern-catalog/` directly to learn about declarative MAS design principles and best practices.

## Pattern Overview

See [pattern-catalog/README.md](./pattern-catalog/README.md)

## Evolution Plan

POMASA is a continuously evolving project:

- Extract new patterns as more systems are built and operated
- Refine existing pattern descriptions based on practical feedback
- Explore pattern variants and adaptations across different domains
