## 1. Introduction

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent runtime environments has fundamentally altered the landscape of software architecture. Where traditional software systems require precise, imperative code to specify every execution step, LLM-based systems can interpret natural language descriptions of intent and autonomously determine how to achieve specified goals. This capability enables a new class of software: Declarative Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks through natural language blueprints rather than compiled code.

However, this nascent field lacks a shared vocabulary for design. Development teams building declarative MAS repeatedly encounter similar challenges—how to define agent behavior, how agents should communicate, how to ensure output quality, how to prevent AI hallucinations—yet each team develops ad hoc solutions without the benefit of accumulated collective wisdom. This situation mirrors the state of object-oriented programming before the publication of design patterns: practitioners solving the same problems independently, unable to efficiently transfer hard-won insights.

This paper presents POMASA (Pattern-Oriented Multi-Agent System Architecture), a pattern language for constructing declarative multi-agent systems. POMASA is neither a framework (it imposes no mandatory code structure) nor a tool (the generator we provide is merely one way to apply it). At its core, POMASA is a pattern language—a network of interconnected design patterns that guide both humans and AI in building MAS.

The pattern language comprises 15 patterns organized into four categories: Core patterns (COR) that define fundamental system characteristics, Structure patterns (STR) that organize static system architecture, Behavior patterns (BHV) that define dynamic system behavior, and Quality patterns (QUA) that ensure system reliability. Each pattern is further classified by necessity: must patterns that every system requires, recommended patterns that most systems benefit from, and optional patterns for specific scenarios.

Beyond documenting patterns, this paper advances a key insight about the nature of pattern languages in the AI era: **for AI runtime environments, pattern languages themselves become executable**. Unlike traditional pattern languages that serve as design guidance requiring human translation into code, POMASA patterns can be directly interpreted by AI systems to generate working MAS implementations. This property transforms the meaning of "open source"—publishing a pattern language paper becomes equivalent to releasing source code, as readers can present the patterns to an AI system and reconstruct the architecture.

We demonstrate POMASA through an industry analysis system that employs 8 agents to conduct systematic research on industrial sectors. This system processes information through a pipeline of collection, verification, analysis, and synthesis, ultimately producing academic-quality reports with full data lineage. The system has been deployed in practice, producing substantive analysis reports that demonstrate the viability of the pattern language approach.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the industry analysis system that serves as our running example. Section 3 describes the pattern language's organizational structure. Section 4 presents eight essential patterns in detail. Section 5 demonstrates how patterns combine to form a working system. Section 6 elaborates the key insight about executable pattern languages. Section 7 discusses implications, limitations, and concludes.
